The name of the file in which we have our PPIs.
[PPI_FILE:<ppi_list.txt>]

The name of the fasta file in which we have UniProt IDs accompanied by their respective sequences.
The UniProt IDs must be the same as the ones in PPI_FILE.
[FASTA_FILE:<protein_sequences.fasta>]

The desired UniRef Cluster homology level, followed by the name of the uniref file in which we have the correspondence between UniProt IDs and UniRef Cluster IDs.
The UniProt IDs must be the same as the ones in PPI_FILE.
[UNIREF_FILE:100:<uniprot_idmapping_UniRef100.dat>]

The number of GOs to consider that have the greatest number of PPIs.
[TOP_GO_NUMBER:10000]

The minimum number of PPI's that a GO must have to not be ignored, followed by the maximum a GO can have.
[PPI_NUMBER:100:10000]

The IDs of the GOs that are going to be considered.
